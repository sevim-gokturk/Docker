# Docker Container Basic Operations

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to give students the knowledge of basic operation on Docker containers.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- list the help about the Docker commands.

- run a Docker container on EC2 instance.

- list the running and stopped Docker containers.

- explain the properties of Docker containers.

- start, stop, and remove Docker containers.

## Outline

- Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Part 2 - Basic Container Commands of Docker

## Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Launch a Docker machine on Amazon Linux 2 AMI with security group allowing SSH connections using the [Cloudformation Template for Docker Machine Installation](../S1A-docker-01-installing-on-ec2-linux2/docker-installation-template.yml).

- Connect to your instance with SSH.

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/call-training.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-133-106-98.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

## Part 2 - Install Docker on Amazon Linux 2 EC2 Instance

- Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

- Install the most recent Docker Community Edition package.

```bash
sudo yum install docker -y
```

- Start docker service.

- Init System: Init (short for initialization) is the first process started during booting of the computer system. It is a daemon process that continues running until the system is shut down. It also controls services at the background. For starting docker service, init system should be informed.

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

- Enable docker service so that docker service can restart automatically after reboots.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

- Check if the docker service is up and running.

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

- Add the `ec2-user` to the `docker` group to run docker commands without using `sudo`.
 sudo kllmd
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```

- Normally, the user needs to re-login into bash shell for the group `docker` to be effective, but `newgrp` command can be used activate `docker` group for `ec2-user`, not to re-login into bash shell.
ec2 docker grb dhl
```bash
newgrp docker
```

- Check the docker version without `sudo`.

```bash
docker version

- Check the docker info without `sudo`.

```bash
docker info
```
## Part 2 - Basic Container Commands of Docker

- Check if the docker service is up and running.
```bash
docker --version
```
- Run either `docker` or `docker help` to see the help docs about docker commands.

```bash
docker help | less
Shift+p+q
```

- Run `docker COMMAND --help` to see more information about specific command.

```bash
docker run --help | less
```
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
- Download and run `ubuntu` os with interactive shell open.

```bash
docker run -i -t ubuntu bash
```

- Display the os name on the container for the current user.

```bash
ls
cat /etc/os-release
```

- Display the shell name on the container for the current user.

```bash
echo $0
```

- Update and upgrade os packages on `ubuntu` container.

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

- Show that `ubuntu` container is like any other Ubuntu system but limited.

  - Go to the home folder and create a file named as `myfile.txt`

    ```bash
    cd ~ && touch myfile.txt && ls
    pwd
    exit
    ```
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash
pwd
cd
whoami
ls 
pwd
```

```bash
exit
```
Docker container properties

- Show the list of all containers available on Docker machine and explain container properties.
process linüx prog çlş hln

```bash
 docker ps --help
docker ps -a
```

or

```bash
docker container ls -a
```
 Docker start

```bash
docker start --help
docker start 2270421f0032
docker ps
docker start 342
docker ps -a
docker start romantic_colden
```
- Run the second `ubuntu` os with interactive shell open and name container as `sevim` and show that this `ubuntu` container is different from the previous one.

```bash
docker run -it --name sevim ubuntu bash
exit
docker ps -a
```

- Show the list of all containers again and explain the second `ubuntu` containers' properties and how the names of containers are given.

```bash
docker container ls -a
```

- Restart the first container by its `ID`.

```bash
docker start 4e6
```

- Show only running containers and explain the status.

```bash
docker container ls
```

- Stop the first container by its `ID` and show it is stopped.

```bash
docker stop 4e6 && docker container ls -a
```

- Restart the `sevim` container by its name and list only running containers.

```bash
docker start sevim && docker container ls
```

- Connect to the interactive shell of running `sevim` container and `exit` afterwards.
İmage list

```bash
docker images
docker image ls
```

```bash
docker run nginx
ctrl c
docker ps -a
docker  rm ca73691

docker run -d nginx
docker ps
docker rm -f 38
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
docker exec 1db32 ls pwd date
docker exec -it 1db32 bash
exit
```
exec cont iç comt çlştm
- Show that  container has stopped by listing all containers.

```bash
docker run -d -p 81:80 httpd
docker container ls -a
```

- Restart the first container by its `ID` again and exec -it to it to show that the file we have created is still there under the home folder, and exit afterwards.

```bash
docker start 4e6 && docker exec -it 4e6 bash
exit
```

- Show that we can get more information about `sevim` container by using `docker inspect` command and explain the properties.

```bash
docker inspect sevim | less
```

- Delete the first container using its `ID`.

```bash
docker rm 4e6
```

- Delete the second container using its name.

```bash
docker rm 124
docker container rm -f 6354
docker container prune # delete stoped containers
docker container rm -f $(docker ps -aq) #delete all containers
```

- Show that both of containers are not listed anymore.

```bash
docker container ls -a
```
